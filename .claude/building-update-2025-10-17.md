## Technical Changes

### Files Modified

1. **[buildings_all.csv](../buildings_all.csv)**
   - Added descriptions for all 39 buildings
   - Added asset file paths (assets/buildings/{category}/{id}.png)
   - Fixed comma issues in descriptions for proper CSV parsing
   - Removed unused columns: jobsRequired, educationRequired, foodRequired, housingRequired, healthcareRequired

2. **[buildings-data.json](../buildings-data.json)**
   - Completely regenerated from CSV with all 39 buildings
   - Proper JSON structure with economics, resources, livability, graphics sections
   - All buildings include full CARENS data (culture, affordability, resilience, environment, noise, safety)

3. **[convert-csv-to-json.js](../convert-csv-to-json.js)**
   - Created proper CSV parser that handles quoted fields
   - Converts CSV to game-ready JSON format
   - Includes category breakdown and statistics

---

## CSV Parsing Issues Fixed

**Problem:** Three building descriptions contained commas which caused CSV parsing errors:
- community_theatre: "plays, concerts, and cultural events"
- bakery: "bread, pastries, and baked goods"
- ice_cream_parlor: "ice cream, sundaes, and frozen treats"

**Solution:** Changed commas to "and" to maintain readability without breaking CSV format:
- community_theatre: "plays and concerts and cultural events"
- bakery: "bread and pastries and baked goods"
- ice_cream_parlor: "ice cream and sundaes and frozen treats"

---

## Building Data Structure

Each building now includes:

```javascript
{
  "id": "building_id",
  "name": "Display Name",
  "category": "civic|commercial|education|energy|healthcare|housing|industrial|recreation",
  "description": "Human-readable description",
  "graphicsFile": "assets/buildings/{category}/{id}.png",
  "isDefault": true|false,
  "civicScore": 0.0,
  "economics": {
    "buildCost": 0,
    "constructionDays": 0,
    "maxRevenue": 0,
    "maintenanceCost": 0,
    "decayRate": 0.0
  },
  "resources": {
    "jobsProvided": 0,
    "energyProvided": 0,
    "energyRequired": 0,
    "educationProvided": 0,
    "foodProvided": 0,
    "housingProvided": 0,
    "healthcareProvided": 0
  },
  "livability": {
    "culture": { "impact": 0, "attenuation": 0 },
    "affordability": { "impact": 0, "attenuation": 0 },
    "resilience": { "impact": 0, "attenuation": 0 },
    "environment": { "impact": 0, "attenuation": 0 },
    "noise": { "impact": 0, "attenuation": 0 },
    "safety": { "impact": 0, "attenuation": 0 }
  },
  "graphics": {
    "default": "assets/buildings/{category}/{id}.png"
  },
  "images": {
    "thumbnail": "assets/buildings/{category}/{id}.png",
    "icon": "assets/buildings/{category}/{id}.png"
  }
}
```

---

## Asset File Paths

All buildings use consistent path structure:
```
assets/buildings/{category}/{building_id}.png
```

**Examples:**
- `assets/buildings/civic/fire_station.png`
- `assets/buildings/commercial/bakery.png`
- `assets/buildings/education/art_school.png`
- `assets/buildings/energy/solar_farm.png`
- `assets/buildings/healthcare/hospital.png`
- `assets/buildings/housing/cottage.png`
- `assets/buildings/industrial/brewery.png`
- `assets/buildings/recreation/skate_park.png`

**Note:** Public goods (civic, education, healthcare) intentionally have poor investment scores because they lose money but provide vital JEEFHH resources and CARENS benefits to enable profitable private buildings.

---

## Game Balance Philosophy

**Public Goods Lose Money, Private Goods Make Money**

This intentional design creates strategic depth:

1. **Civic Buildings (Public Goods)**
   - Negative or zero direct revenue
   - High maintenance costs
   - Provide essential services (safety, culture, environment)
   - Enable profitability of nearby commercial/housing

2. **Commercial Buildings (Private Goods)**
   - Positive revenue when needs met
   - Create jobs
   - Provide food (grocers, restaurants)
   - Benefit from good CARENS scores

3. **Education Buildings (Public Investment)**
   - Schools lose money but provide education resource
   - Education boosts worker productivity city-wide
   - Art schools can profit but require culture/education demand

4. **Energy Buildings (Utility Mix)**
   - Coal: High energy, low cost, terrible environment
   - Solar: Low energy, low cost, great environment
   - Gas: Medium energy, medium cost, medium environment

5. **Healthcare Buildings (Mixed)**
   - Large hospitals lose money but provide vital healthcare
   - Massage parlors can profit as luxury services
   - Healthcare improves safety and quality of life

6. **Housing Buildings (Core Revenue)**
   - Revenue scales with housing shortage (1.0x - 1.5x multiplier)
   - Residents need jobs, food, healthcare, education
   - Dense housing = more revenue but lower affordability

7. **Industrial Buildings (Jobs + Products)**
   - Provide jobs and produce goods
   - Often negative CARENS impact (pollution, noise)
   - Necessary but require management

8. **Recreation Buildings (Quality of Life)**
   - Skate park provides culture at low cost
   - Improves CARENS scores for surrounding areas
   - Low revenue but high strategic value

## Next Steps

### For Players

When you load the game, you should now see:
1. **39 buildings available** in the build menu
2. **Updated hospital economics** making it more viable
3. **Updated trade school decay** making it more sustainable
4. **Descriptions for all buildings** showing their purpose
5. **Proper asset paths** (graphics will load when assets are created)

### For Developers

**Assets Needed:** Create 39 PNG images at the paths specified in buildings-data.json:
```
assets/buildings/civic/ (6 images)
assets/buildings/commercial/ (11 images)
assets/buildings/education/ (5 images)
assets/buildings/energy/ (3 images)
assets/buildings/healthcare/ (4 images)
assets/buildings/housing/ (7 images)
assets/buildings/industrial/ (2 images)
assets/buildings/recreation/ (1 image)
```

**Server Status:** Server is running on port 3001. Client will automatically load new buildings-data.json when refreshed.

**Future Balance:** User will separately adjust:
- Building costs/revenues for large buildings (ROI improvements)
- Coal plant decay rate (currently 22%/day, may be too high)
- Individual building economics based on playtesting
