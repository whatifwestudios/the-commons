# Economic Balance Changes - October 17, 2025

## Summary
Refined the economic multiplier systems to reduce extreme penalties while maintaining strategic interdependence.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. JEEFHH Global Multiplier - Weighted Average System ✅

**Problem:** The old system used `Math.min()` to take the worst-performing resource, causing total economic collapse from a single shortage.

**Example of Old System:**
- 5 resources perfectly balanced (1.6x each)
- 1 resource in shortage (0.4x)
- **Result: Entire economy = 0.4x** (75% penalty for everyone)

**New System:** Weighted average with imbalance penalties
```javascript
// Calculate average of all 6 multipliers
const avgMultiplier = multipliers.reduce((sum, m) => sum + m, 0) / 6;

// Apply penalty for imbalanced resources (below 1.0x)
const imbalancedResources = multipliers.filter(m => m < 1.0).length;
const imbalancePenalty = imbalancedResources * 0.05;

// Final multiplier (clamped to 0.4x - 1.6x)
const globalMultiplier = Math.max(0.4, Math.min(1.6, avgMultiplier - imbalancePenalty));
```

**Example of New System:**
- 5 resources at 1.6x, 1 resource at 0.4x
- Average = (1.6×5 + 0.4×1) / 6 = 1.4x
- Penalty = 1 resource below 1.0 × 0.05 = 0.05x
- **Result: Global multiplier = 1.35x** (35% bonus instead of 75% penalty)

**Benefits:**
- Maintains economic interdependence
- Avoids catastrophic single-resource collapse
- Still rewards balanced economies
- Makes the game more playable and less punishing

### 2. CARENS Multiplier Range - Expanded to Match JEEFHH ✅

**Changed:** Expanded CARENS range from **0.6x - 1.4x** to **0.4x - 1.6x**

**Reason:** CARENS (quality of life) now has equal economic impact as JEEFHH (resource balance), making livability equally important to resource management.

**Formula Change:**
```javascript
// Old formula
const multiplier = 1.0 + (netCarensTotal / 100) * 0.4;  // ±40%
const clamped = Math.max(0.6, Math.min(1.4, multiplier));

// New formula
const multiplier = 1.0 + (netCarensTotal / 100) * 0.6;  // ±60%
const clamped = Math.max(0.4, Math.min(1.6, multiplier));
```

**Impact:**
- Great livability (+100 points) = **1.6x** multiplier (up from 1.4x)
- Terrible livability (-100 points) = **0.4x** multiplier (down from 0.6x)
- Now matches JEEFHH importance (was 2.33x spread, now 4.0x spread)

## Economic Impact Analysis

### Before Changes (Worst Case Scenario)
```
Resources:
- Jobs: 1.6x
- Energy: 1.6x
- Education: 1.6x
- Food: 1.6x
- Housing: 0.4x  ← Single shortage
- Healthcare: 1.6x

Global JEEFHH: 0.4x (worst resource)
CARENS: 1.4x (great quality of life)
Building performance: 100% (all needs met locally)

Final Revenue = Base × 1.0 × 1.4 × 0.4 = Base × 0.56
Result: 44% revenue penalty despite perfect local performance
```

### After Changes (Same Scenario)
```
Resources:
- Jobs: 1.6x
- Energy: 1.6x
- Education: 1.6x
- Food: 1.6x
- Housing: 0.4x  ← Single shortage
- Healthcare: 1.6x

Average: (1.6×5 + 0.4) / 6 = 1.4x
Penalty: 1 resource below 1.0 × 0.05 = -0.05x
Global JEEFHH: 1.35x

CARENS: 1.6x (great quality of life, now more impactful)
Building performance: 100% (all needs met locally)

Final Revenue = Base × 1.0 × 1.6 × 1.35 = Base × 2.16
Result: 116% revenue BONUS despite one shortage
```

**Improvement:** From 56% penalty to 116% bonus in this scenario!

---

## Perfect Balance Scenarios

### All Resources Perfectly Balanced (1.0 ratio each)
```
Before:
- Each resource: 1.6x multiplier
- Global: min(1.6, 1.6, 1.6, 1.6, 1.6, 1.6) = 1.6x
- CARENS: 1.4x max
- Maximum revenue: Base × 1.4 × 1.6 × 1.4 = Base × 3.136

After:
- Each resource: 1.6x multiplier
- Average: 1.6x, Penalty: 0 (none below 1.0)
- Global: 1.6x
- CARENS: 1.6x max (increased)
- Maximum revenue: Base × 1.4 × 1.6 × 1.6 = Base × 3.584
```

**Perfect balance is now MORE rewarding** (14% higher max revenue)

## Strategic Implications

### Old System Incentives
- **Extreme caution** - One mistake tanks entire economy
- **Cooperative stalemate** - No one dares build anything risky
- **Bottleneck warfare** - Intentional sabotage by withholding one resource

### New System Incentives
- **Balanced growth** - Still rewards balance but forgives temporary shortages
- **Risk-taking viable** - Can experiment with new building types
- **Strategic diversity** - Multiple paths to economic success
- **Quality matters** - CARENS now equally important as JEEFHH

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Single Resource Shortage:**
   - Build 5/6 resource types in balance
   - Observe economic multiplier (should be ~1.3x-1.4x, not 0.4x)

2. **Test Multiple Shortages:**
   - Have 3 resources below 1.0x
   - Penalty should be 3 × 0.05 = 0.15x
   - Still recoverable economy

3. **Test Perfect Balance:**
   - All 6 resources at 1.0 ratio
   - Should achieve 1.6x global multiplier
   - With good CARENS, max revenue should be ~3.5x base

4. **Test CARENS Impact:**
   - Build parks, libraries (culture +)
   - Build coal plants (environment -)
   - Observe revenue changes (should be significant)

---

## Future Balance Adjustments

The user will separately adjust:
- **Building costs/revenues** (to fix ROI issues with large buildings)
- **Coal Plant decay rate** (currently 22%/day, too high)
- **Housing multiplier cap** (keeping at 1.5x to incentivize housing construction)

---

## Backward Compatibility

**Breaking Change:** Yes - economic calculations fundamentally different

**Migration:** None needed - server will recalculate on next daily tick

**Save Compatibility:** Existing games will experience sudden revenue changes when server updates

---

## Performance Impact

**Negligible** - Same number of calculations, just different formula:
- Old: `Math.min(...multipliers)` - O(n) comparison
- New: `reduce() + filter()` - O(n) average + O(n) filter = O(n)

---

## Code Review Notes

All changes maintain exact parity between:
- Server calculations ([server-economic-engine.js](../server-economic-engine.js))
- Client calculations ([economic-client.js](../economic-client.js))
- Client performance calculator ([client-performance-calculator.js](../client-performance-calculator.js))

This ensures:
- ✅ No client-server drift
- ✅ Instant UI feedback matches reality
- ✅ Tooltips show accurate predictions
- ✅ Server remains authoritative
