# Session Notes - Land Exchange Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Commit**: c6927f9 - "Replace parcel auction system with Land Exchange + simplify Actions"

## What Was Completed

### 1. Action System Overhaul
- **Simplified from two buckets to single bucket**: All actions now rollover monthly (no more "expiring vs purchased" confusion)
- **Changed monthly allowance formula**: 18 actions in Sept ‚Üí 7 actions in Aug (declining by 1/month, down from 20‚Üí10 declining by 2/month)
- **Added action enforcement**:
  - `processBuildStart()` now validates and deducts actions
  - `processParcelPurchase()` now validates and deducts actions
- **Updated UI**: Removed confusing "expiring/rollover" display, now just shows total actions

### 2. Land Exchange System (Replaced Parcel Auctions)
- **Removed entire auction system**: Deleted parcel-auction-system.js (1,252 lines) and all auction-related code
- **New async offer system**:
  - Players make offers on competitor parcels (max 3 active offers per player)
  - Owners MUST respond: accept (free) or match (1 action + pay difference to treasury)
  - NO decline option - forces engagement
  - Public offers enable price discovery (land values rise organically)

### 3. Global Blocking Mechanism
- **Critical rule**: Players with pending offers on ANY of their parcels cannot buy OR build ANYWHERE until all offers are resolved
- **Implementation**:
  - [context-menu-system.js:179-189](context-menu-system.js#L179-L189) - blocks buying when pending offers exist
  - [context-menu-system.js:223-233](context-menu-system.js#L223-L233) - blocks building when pending offers exist
  - Shows clear UI: "üîí BUYING/BUILDING BLOCKED - Resolve pending offers first"

### 4. Hover Preview System
- **Fixed tooltip positioning**: Converts canvas coordinates to screen coordinates properly
  ```javascript
  const screenX = rect.left + canvasX;
  const screenY = rect.top + canvasY;
  ```
- **Building animations**: Sets `selectedTile` and `selectedParcel` to trigger lift/bounce effects
- **Adjacent highlighting**: Calculates `parcelReach` to show adjacent parcels in player color
- **Location**: [land-exchange-system.js:399-449](land-exchange-system.js#L399-L449)

## Key Files Modified

### Server-Side
- **server-economic-engine.js**:
  - Simplified action system (Lines 3457-3607)
  - Added action enforcement (Lines 745-750, 2824-2834)
  - New Land Exchange methods (Lines 4171-4467):
    - `processMakeOffer()` - create offer with validation
    - `processOfferResponse()` - accept or match
    - `processWithdrawOffer()` - remove offer (costs 1 action)
    - Explicit serialization to avoid circular JSON refs

- **server-room-manager.js**:
  - Removed `processExpiredParcelAuctions()` call (Line 637)

### Client-Side
- **land-exchange-system.js**: Complete new file (507 lines)
  - Modal for making offers
  - Sidebar showing active offers (as offerer/owner)
  - Hover preview with proper visual effects

- **context-menu-system.js**:
  - Global blocking implementation
  - Shows pending offers in context menu (must respond)

- **game.js**:
  - Initialize Land Exchange (Lines 527-530)
  - Simplified action display (Lines 921-946)

- **index.html**:
  - Removed 300+ lines of auction CSS
  - Added clean Land Exchange CSS with hover effects

## Errors Fixed

1. **Syntax Error**: Extra closing brace after Land Exchange methods ‚Üí Removed
2. **Circular JSON**: Broadcasting full offer objects ‚Üí Explicitly serialize only safe fields
3. **Missing Method**: `processExpiredParcelAuctions()` still being called ‚Üí Removed call
4. **Global Blocking**: Not blocking ALL actions ‚Üí Added checks for ANY pending offers
5. **Hover Preview**: Wrong tooltip position + missing animations ‚Üí Fixed coordinate conversion + visual effects

## Testing Status

‚úÖ All fixes implemented and pushed to GitHub
‚è≥ **Needs user testing**:
- Verify global blocking works (pending offers block buying/building everywhere)
- Verify hover preview shows tooltip correctly with building animations
- Verify adjacent parcels highlight in player color
- Verify no console errors

## Next Steps When Returning

1. **User should test the Land Exchange system**:
   - Make an offer on a competitor parcel
   - Hover over offer in sidebar ‚Üí verify tooltip + animations work
   - Try to buy/build while pending offers exist ‚Üí should be blocked
   - Accept or match an offer ‚Üí verify parcel transfer/payment works

2. **Potential improvements** (if user requests):
   - Offer expiration timer (currently offers last forever)
   - Notification system when receiving offers
   - Historical offer tracking/analytics
   - Offer comparison UI (multiple offers on same parcel)

3. **Other game systems to review** (based on context):
   - Action Marketplace (may need updates to align with new Action system)
   - Governance system integration
   - Victory conditions

## Architecture Notes

- **Server-authoritative**: All validation on backend, client just sends transactions
- **WebSocket broadcasting**: Real-time updates to all players
- **Explicit serialization**: Avoid circular refs by manually selecting fields to broadcast
- **Single source of truth**: `gameState.landExchange.activeOffers` Map on server
- **Visual effects integration**: Reuses existing rendering system (selectedTile, parcelReach, tooltipSystemV2)

## File Structure Cleanup

Removed `-v2` suffixes from files (now using cleaned-up versions):
- action-marketplace.js
- economic-client.js
- governance.js
- parcel-hover.js
- rendering-system.js
- tooltip-system.js

Kept backup: `server-economic-engine.js.backup-before-land-exchange`
