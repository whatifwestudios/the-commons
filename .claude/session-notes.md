# Session Notes - Commonwealth Score & Victory Screen

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Latest Commit**: (pending) - "Fix Land Exchange building value broadcast"

## What Was Completed

### 1. Fixed Commonwealth Score Modal (NaN Bug)
**Problem**: Leaderboard showing "NaN" after purchasing parcels and paying LVT
**Root Cause**: ui-manager.js accessing old lvtRatio field

**Fix**:
- Updated updateLeaderboard() to use wealthScore, civicScore, score
- Added defensive NaN handling with fallback to '0.0'

### 2. Renamed "Commonwealth Leaderboard" to "Your Score"
**Changes**:
- Modal title and column headers updated
- Rewrote help text explaining dual-score system
- Two victory paths: Early Civic (Score ≥50 + pop ≥100) or Year-End (day 366)

### 3. Implemented Victory Screen UI
**Features**:
- Animated crown modal with golden theme
- Winner announcement with player color badge
- Final scoreboard (all players with Wealth/Civic/Total)
- Game summary stats (6 stats grid)
- victory-screen.js subscribes to GAME_VICTORY WebSocket messages

## Victory Conditions

**Early Civic Victory**: Score ≥50.0 AND population ≥100
**Year-End Victory**: Day 366 (Sept 1) - highest score wins

## Testing Needed

1. Test both victory conditions in multiplayer
2. Verify victory modal displays correctly
3. Test edge cases (ties, disconnects)

## Files Modified (Previous Session)

- ui-manager.js - Fixed NaN bug
- index.html - Victory modal HTML + CSS, updated leaderboard
- victory-screen.js - NEW: Victory modal controller

## Session Continuation: Land Exchange Building Value Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-07

### 4. Fixed Land Exchange Building Value Display

**Problem**: Building value showing $0 in Make Offer modal, despite server calculating correctly

**Root Cause**:
- Server broadcast (OFFER_MADE) was missing `buildingValue` and `escrowAmount` fields
- Client UI couldn't display values that weren't included in the broadcast message

**Cash Flow Analysis** (verified correct):
1. **Escrow (line 4444)**: Correctly debits `offerAmount + buildingValue`
2. **Acceptance (line 4536)**: Refunds decay difference to offerer
3. **Acceptance (line 4541)**: Credits owner with `actualPayment` (offer + current building value)

**Fix**:
- Added `buildingValue` and `escrowAmount` to OFFER_MADE broadcast (lines 4478-4479)
- Client already had UI code to display these values (lines 395, 405, 421, 431 in land-exchange-system.js)

## Files Modified (This Session)

- server-economic-engine.js - Added buildingValue and escrowAmount to broadcast

Ready to commit and test.
