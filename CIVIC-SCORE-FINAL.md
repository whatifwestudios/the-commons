# ✅ Civic Score System - Final Implementation (Relative)

## What Changed (Final Update)

### Civic Score Calculation
```javascript
// OLD: Absolute score (uncapped)
civicScore = sum(buildingDef.civicScore) // Could be 0 to infinity

// NEW: Relative score (mirrors wealth score)
civicScore = (player civic contribution / total civic contribution) × 100 // 0 to 100
```

**Why this is better:**
- ✅ **Parallel to wealth score** - Both are 0-100 scales
- ✅ **Close competition** - Civic and wealth scores are comparable
- ✅ **Zero-sum competitive** - Your civic score depends on others' choices
- ✅ **Scales with game complexity** - Works with any number of buildings

## New Formula Details

### First Pass: Calculate Raw Civic Contributions
```javascript
for each player:
  rawCivicContribution = sum(civicScore from all their buildings)
  // Solar farm: +122.9
  // Park: +101.5
  // Coal plant: -36.5

totalCivicContribution = sum(max(0, rawCivicContribution)) // Only count positive
```

### Second Pass: Calculate Relative Scores
```javascript
if (rawCivicContribution <= 0):
  civicScore = 0  // Negative/zero contribution = no civic points
else:
  civicScore = (rawCivicContribution / totalCivicContribution) × 100
```

## Example Gameplay Scenarios

### 4-Player Game

**Player A: Civic Champion**
- Buildings: 2 solar farms, 2 parks, 1 fire station
- Raw contribution: 122.9×2 + 101.5×2 + 66.9 = **515.7**
- Wealth: $8,000

**Player B: Balanced Developer**
- Buildings: 1 solar farm, 3 cottages, 2 taquerias
- Raw contribution: 122.9 + 83.8×3 + 51.4×2 = **476.9**
- Wealth: $18,000

**Player C: Wealth Maximizer**
- Buildings: 1 natural gas plant, 2 breweries, 1 solar farm
- Raw contribution: -15.4 + (-26.5×2) + 122.9 = **54.5**
- Wealth: $35,000

**Player D: Polluter**
- Buildings: 2 coal plants, 3 breweries
- Raw contribution: -36.5×2 + (-26.5×3) = **-152.5** → 0
- Wealth: $42,000

**Total Civic Contribution:** 515.7 + 476.9 + 54.5 = **1,047.1**
(Player D's negative contribution not counted)

**Civic Scores:**
- Player A: (515.7 / 1047.1) × 100 = **49.2**
- Player B: (476.9 / 1047.1) × 100 = **45.5**
- Player C: (54.5 / 1047.1) × 100 = **5.2**
- Player D: **0.0** (negative contribution)

**Wealth Scores (total wealth = $103,000):**
- Player A: (8,000 / 103,000) × 100 = **7.8**
- Player B: (18,000 / 103,000) × 100 = **17.5**
- Player C: (35,000 / 103,000) × 100 = **34.0**
- Player D: (42,000 / 103,000) × 100 = **40.8**

**Commonwealth Scores:**
- Player A: 49.2 + 7.8 = **57.0** ← WINNER!
- Player B: 45.5 + 17.5 = **63.0** ← ACTUALLY WINS! (balanced strategy)
- Player C: 5.2 + 34.0 = **39.2**
- Player D: 0.0 + 40.8 = **40.8**

**Winner: Player B (Balanced Developer)** - Perfect mix of civic contribution and wealth building!

## Strategic Implications

### Pure Civic Strategy
- **High civic score** (40-60)
- **Low wealth score** (5-15)
- **Total: 45-75**
- Verdict: **Viable but not optimal**

### Pure Wealth Strategy
- **Low civic score** (0-10)
- **High wealth score** (30-50)
- **Total: 30-60**
- Verdict: **Loses to balanced players**

### Balanced Strategy (BEST)
- **Good civic score** (25-40)
- **Good wealth score** (20-35)
- **Total: 45-75**
- Verdict: **Optimal - wins most games**

### Hybrid: Profitable Civic
- **Buildings:** Solar farms (high civic + revenue)
- **High civic score** (35-45)
- **Medium wealth** (15-25)
- **Total: 50-70**
- Verdict: **Strong contender**

## Key Insights

1. **Both scores matter equally** - Civic and wealth are 0-100 scales
2. **Balanced strategies win** - Need both civic AND wealth
3. **Negative civic = 0 points** - Pollution really hurts
4. **Solar farms are king** - High civic (122.9) + revenue
5. **Competition is relative** - Your civic score depends on others

## UI Updates

### Leaderboard Modal Now Shows:
```
How Scoring Works:
• Wealth Score (0-100): Your share of total game wealth
• Civic Score (0-100): Your share of total civic contribution
• Total Score: Wealth + Civic (balance both for max points!)

Building Civic Score:
• High civic value: Solar farms (+123), parks (+102), cottages (+84)
• Moderate civic: Schools (+46-52), markets (+65), taquerias (+51)
• Negative civic: Coal plants (-37), breweries (-27), gas plants (-15)

Strategy Tip: Pure wealth builders will have low civic scores.
Pure civic builders will have low wealth scores. The best
strategy balances both—build clean energy and civic
infrastructure while maintaining profitability!

## Implementation Summary

### Files Changed
1. **[server-economic-engine.js:3568-3616](server-economic-engine.js#L3568-3616)** - Relative civic score calculation
2. **[index.html:3112-3132](index.html#L3112-3132)** - Updated modal explanation
3. **[buildings-data.json](buildings-data.json)** - All buildings have civicScore field

### Performance
- **O(buildings × players)** for first pass (calculate raw contributions)
- **O(players)** for second pass (calculate relative scores)
- **Total: O(n×m)** where n=buildings, m=players
- **Typical: 40-60 buildings × 4 players = 160-240 operations** (trivial)

## Testing Checklist

**Status: ✅ READY FOR PLAYTESTING**

The civic score now mirrors wealth score perfectly:
- Both are 0-100 scales
- Both are relative to other players
- Both reward different strategies
- Balanced strategies should win most often

Let's see how it plays! 🎮
