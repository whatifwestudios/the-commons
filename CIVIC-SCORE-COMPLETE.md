# ✅ Civic Score System - Implementation Complete

## What Changed

### Old System (Gameable)
```javascript
civicScore = (LVT Paid / Public Funding Received) × 10
```
- **Problem**: Rich players who avoid civic buildings got highest scores
- **Behavior**: Players minimized public infrastructure use
- **Not aligned with theme**: Didn't measure "common good"

### New System (CARENS-Based)
```javascript
civicScore = sum(buildingDef.civicScore) for all player's buildings
// Where civicScore = sum(impact / sqrt(attenuation)) for all CARENS dimensions
```
- **Solution**: Players must build civic infrastructure to score
- **Behavior**: Encourages parks, schools, clean energy
- **Thematically perfect**: Measures actual contribution to common good

## Implementation Details

### 1. CARENS Values Rebalanced ✅
- All buildings now have double-digit CARENS impacts
- Negative impacts properly signed (coal plant: -80 environment)
- See [buildings-data-final.csv](buildings-data-final.csv)

### 2. Civic Scores Pre-Calculated ✅
- Formula: `civicScore = sum(impact / sqrt(attenuation))`
- Pre-calculated and stored in [buildings-data.json](buildings-data.json)
- No runtime computation needed!

### 3. Server Implementation ✅
- Updated `calculateCommonwealthScores()` in [server-economic-engine.js:3591](server-economic-engine.js#L3591)
- Simply sums pre-calculated civic scores from player's buildings
- Caps at 187.9 (Henry George reference)

## Civic Score Rankings

| Rank | Building | Civic Score | Category |
|------|----------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Solar Farm | 122.9 | energy |
| 2 | Park | 101.5 | civic |
| 3 | Cottage | 83.8 | housing |
| 4 | Fire Station | 66.9 | civic |
| 5 | Farmers Market | 65.1 | commercial |
| 6 | High School | 51.6 | education |
| 7 | Taqueria | 51.4 | commercial |
| 8 | Elementary School | 45.5 | education |

| 10 | Library | 38.8 | civic |
| 11 | Apartment Complex | 33.8 | housing |
| 12 | Public Pool | 28.3 | civic |
| 13 | Natural Gas Plant | **-15.4** | energy |
| 14 | Brewery | **-26.5** | industrial |
| 15 | Coal Plant | **-36.5** | energy |

## Gameplay Impact

### Winning Strategies

**Solar + Park = Instant Win**
- Solar Farm: 122.9
- Park: 101.5
- **Total: 224.4** → Capped at 187.9 ✓

**Affordable Housing Path**
- 3x Cottage: 83.8 each
- **Total: 251.4** → Capped at 187.9 ✓

**Balanced Civic Portfolio**
- Fire Station: 66.9
- Farmers Market: 65.1
- High School: 51.6
- **Total: 183.6** → Nearly maxed

### Losing Strategy
**Industrial Tycoon**
- Coal Plant: -36.5
- Brewery: -26.5
- Natural Gas: -15.4
- **Total: -78.4** ✗ Terrible civic score!

## Key Insights

1. **Clean energy dominates** - Solar Farm is #1 civic building
2. **Affordable housing is civic** - Cottages rank #3!
3. **Pollution is heavily penalized** - Coal plant: -36.5 points
4. **Multiple paths to victory** - Solar/parks, housing, or balanced civic
5. **Can't ignore it** - Industrial players will have negative civic scores

## Performance

- **O(buildings_owned)** - Just sum pre-calculated values
- **Zero CARENS calculations** - All done at JSON load time
- **Trivial CPU impact** - ~50 additions per player worst case

## Files Changed

1. [buildings-data.json](buildings-data.json) - Added `civicScore` field to all buildings
2. [server-economic-engine.js](server-economic-engine.js) - New civic score calculation (line 3591)
3. [buildings-data-final.csv](buildings-data-final.csv) - Rebalanced CARENS values

## Documentation

- [docs/civic-score-final-summary.md](docs/civic-score-final-summary.md) - Complete system overview
- [docs/civic-score-simple-carens.md](docs/civic-score-simple-carens.md) - Design rationale
- [docs/carens-rebalance-explanation.md](docs/carens-rebalance-explanation.md) - CARENS rebalancing details
- [docs/civic-score-market-driven.md](docs/civic-score-market-driven.md) - Alternative approaches explored

## Next Steps

1. **Playtest** - See if scores feel balanced
2. **Tune if needed**:
   - If too easy to max: Scale down scores by 50%
   - If cottage spam: Add diminishing returns
   - If not competitive: Make it relative to other players
3. **Add UI breakdown** - Show player's civic score composition

## Testing

Start a game and try these scenarios:

1. **Build solar farm + park** - Should quickly hit 187.9 civic score
2. **Build coal plant + brewery** - Should have negative civic score
3. **Build 3 cottages** - Should have ~250 civic points (capped at 187.9)
4. **Mix industrial and civic** - Should see tradeoffs

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE AND READY TO TEST**

The new civic scoring system is:
- ✅ Simple (just sum building scores)
- ✅ Intuitive (build civic stuff = civic points)
- ✅ Performant (pre-calculated, O(n) sum)
- ✅ Thematically aligned (measures common good)
- ✅ Strategically deep (multiple paths to victory)
