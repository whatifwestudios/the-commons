# Governance Transition System - Implementation Notes

## ðŸ“‹ What Was Implemented

Successfully created a complete pre-game to gameplay governance transition system that:

1. **Pre-Game Phase (Beer Hall Lobby)**:
   - Players get 4 points for LVT-only setup
   - Only Land Value Tax rate can be modified (+/- 1% per point)
   - Clear instructions explain this sets starting rate
   - Modal has backdrop blur blocking UI interaction
   - Updated button text: "Confirm LVT Rate"

2. **Game Start Transition**:
   - Pre-game LVT votes are locked permanently via `pregameLVTVotes` field
   - Players reset to 2 points for regular governance
   - All budget categories become available
   - LVT rate can still be modified from the locked baseline

3. **Key Files Modified**:
   - `governance-system.js`: Added `gameStarted` flag, `pregameLVTVotes` tracking, `startGameplay()` method
   - `beer-hall-lobby.js`: Limited to LVT-only voting, integrated with main governance system
   - `server-room-manager.js`: Calls `startGameplay()` when game begins
   - `index.html`: Updated governance panel with instructions and styling

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Core Governance Changes
- Added `governance.gameStarted` boolean flag
- Added `governance.pregameLVTVotes` per player to track locked baseline
- Modified voting points: 4 (pre-game) â†’ 2 (gameplay)
- `startGameplay()` method handles the transition

### Beer Hall Integration
- Removed parallel governance state - now uses main `GovernanceSystem`
- Only renders LVT category during pre-game
- Proper server transaction integration
- Shows current LVT rate in chat confirmations

### Server Integration
- `server-room-manager.js` line ~202: Added governance transition call
- Happens during 3-second game start countdown
- Logs show LVT rate locked and points reset

## ðŸŽ® User Experience Flow

1. **Lobby**: Players see "Pre-Game LVT Setup" with 4 points, instructions, LVT-only voting
2. **Game Start**: Server locks pre-game votes, resets to 2 points for regular governance
3. **Gameplay**: Full governance available, but pre-game LVT baseline is permanent
4. **LVT Changes**: Can still modify LVT rate using new points, but can't reclaim original 4

## âœ… Confirmed Working

- LVT voting works (increase/decrease)
- Point deduction works (4â†’3â†’2â†’1â†’0)
- No double allocation issues
- Pre-game votes get locked on game start
- Points reset to 2 for gameplay
- LVT rate can still be modified during game
- Backdrop blur blocks UI interaction

## ðŸš€ Status: COMPLETE

All requested features implemented and tested. System handles the transition seamlessly from pre-game LVT setup to full gameplay governance while permanently locking the initial 4 points.
