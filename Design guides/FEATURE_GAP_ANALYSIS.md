## 2. Energy System Deficiencies

### Current State vs Design Goals

**Design Requirement**: "Energy must ALL exist in some quantity for population to arrive"
**Current Implementation**: Only 1 energy building type available

#### **Available Energy Sources**
```javascript
// Current: Only solar farm (building-template-v2.csv:11)
solar_farm: { energy: 25, cost: 2000 }
```

#### **Missing Energy Infrastructure**
```javascript
// From GAME_DESIGN.md - Required for population ignition
coal_plant: { energy: 50, cost: 3000, carens: { environment: -10, safety: -5 } }
wind_farm: { energy: 30, cost: 2500, carens: { environment: +15, noise: -10 } }
nuclear_plant: { energy: 100, cost: 8000, carens: { safety: -20, resilience: +10 } }
geothermal: { energy: 40, cost: 4000, carens: { environment: +10 } }
```

**Impact**: Players cannot create diverse energy portfolios, limiting strategic economic choices and violating core design principle.

**Implementation Status**: **5% Complete** (1 of 6+ energy types)

### Recommended Energy Buildings CSV Addition

```

## 3. Transportation/Mobility System Gap

### Design Vision vs Current State

**Design Goal**: Complete transportation infrastructure enabling resource flow optimization
**Current Status**: **0% Implemented** (System archived but not integrated)

#### **Evidence of Planned Transportation System**
```javascript
// From archived mobility code - shows comprehensive system was planned
/home/zjb/the-commons-clean/archive/mobility/MOBILITY_V2_DESIGN.md
/home/zjb/the-commons-clean/archive/mobility/MOBILITY_CODE_ANALYSIS.md

// Current placeholder in game.js:1762
// DISABLED: Mobility layer completely removed
if (layerName === 'mobility') {
    console.log('⚠️ Mobility layer disabled - using normal mode');
    layerName = 'normal';
}
```

#### **Missing Transportation Features**
1. **Road Network Infrastructure**
   - Street placement and management
   - Intersection handling
   - Network connectivity algorithms

2. **Public Transit Systems**
   - Bus routes and stops
   - Train/subway lines
   - Transit efficiency calculations

3. **Resource Flow Optimization**
   - Building connectivity via roads
   - Supply chain efficiency bonuses
   - Transportation-based CARENS impacts

4. **Multiplayer Transportation Ownership**
   - Shared infrastructure maintenance
   - Transit route governance
   - Cross-parcel road rights

**Implementation Complexity**: **High** - Requires new subsystem integration

### Integration Approach for Transportation

```javascript
// Recommended: Phased transportation integration
// Phase 1: Basic road placement (2 weeks)
class BasicRoadSystem {
    placeRoad(row, col, playerId) {
        // Server-authoritative road placement
        // Integration point: server-economic-engine-v2.js:500-600
    }

    calculateConnectivity(buildingRow, buildingCol) {
        // Road-based building bonuses
        // Integration point: server-economic-engine-v2.js:850-900
    }
}

// Phase 2: Advanced transit (4 weeks)
class TransitSystem extends BasicRoadSystem {
    createTransitRoute(stops, routeType) {
        // Bus/train route management
    }

    calculateTransitEfficiency() {
        // CARENS impact from transit accessibility
    }
}
```

## 4. Land Value Tax Auction System

### Current vs Design Implementation

**Design Goal**: "Hostile takeover auctions for underutilized parcels"
**Current Status**: **40% Complete** (LVT calculation exists, auction system missing)

#### **What Exists**
```javascript
// server-economic-engine-v2.js:2826-2861 - LVT calculation
calculateLVTPayments() {
    Object.entries(this.parcels).forEach(([parcelKey, parcel]) => {
        if (parcel.ownerId && parcel.landValue > 0) {
            const lvtAmount = parcel.landValue * this.governance.currentLvtRate;
            // TODO: Connect to auction trigger system
        }
    });
}
```

#### **Missing Auction Components**
1. **Auction Triggering Logic**
   - Parcel utilization analysis
   - Minimum bid calculations
   - Owner notification system

2. **Bidding Interface**
   - Real-time auction UI
   - Bid validation and history
   - Current owner retention rights

3. **Ownership Transfer System**
   - Deed transfer mechanics
   - Building ownership during sale
   - Tax reset after purchase

**Implementation Status**: **40% Complete** (infrastructure exists, auction logic missing)

### Recommended Auction System Implementation

```javascript
// Extend existing action marketplace patterns
class ParcelAuctionSystem extends ActionMarketplace {
    constructor(economicEngine) {
        super(economicEngine);
        this.activeParcelAuctions = new Map();
    }

    triggerLVTAuction(parcelKey, owedTaxes, parcelValue) {
        // Trigger auction for tax-delinquent parcels
        const minimumBid = parcelValue * 1.1; // 110% of current value

        const auction = {
            parcelKey,
            minimumBid,
            currentBid: minimumBid,
            currentBidder: null,
            originalOwner: this.economicEngine.parcels[parcelKey].ownerId,
            endTime: Date.now() + (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // 24 hours
            status: 'active'
        };

        this.activeParcelAuctions.set(parcelKey, auction);
        this.broadcastAuctionStart(auction);
    }

    // Integration point: server-economic-engine-v2.js:2850
    processLVTPayment(playerId, amount, parcelKey) {
        // If payment fails, trigger auction
        if (playerCash < amount) {
            this.triggerLVTAuction(parcelKey, amount, parcelValue);
        }
    }
}
```

## 5. Incomplete Infrastructure & TODO Items

### Critical TODO Items Found

#### **Treasury System Placeholder**
```javascript
// building-system.js:641
// TODO: Get actual treasury balance from server
const totalTreasury = 10000; // PLACEHOLDER VALUE

// Recommendation: Connect to governance system
const totalTreasury = this.economicEngine.governance.treasury.totalFunds;
```

#### **Budget Effects Not Applied**
```javascript
// server-economic-engine-v2.js:2388
// TODO: Apply budget effects (building subsidies, service bonuses, etc.)

// Recommendation: Implement budget multipliers
calculateBuildingRevenue(building) {
    let baseRevenue = building.baseRevenue;

    // Apply governance budget effects
    const budgetCategory = this.getBuildingCategory(building.type);
    const budgetAllocation = this.governance.allocations[budgetCategory] || 0;
    const budgetMultiplier = 1.0 + (budgetAllocation * 0.05); // 5% per point

    return baseRevenue * budgetMultiplier;
}
```

#### **Disabled Client Calculations**
```javascript
// Multiple files contain:
// "CLIENT-SIDE CALCULATION DISABLED - RETURN GHOST PLACEHOLDER"

// Shows incomplete server-client synchronization
// Recommendation: Complete server migration for all economic calculations
```

### Missing Building Prerequisites

#### **Healthcare Infrastructure**
```javascript
// Current: Limited healthcare buildings
// Missing: Clinic, Medical Center, Pharmacy

// Add to building CSV:
