# ✅ Scoring System Updates - Complete Implementation

## Summary of Changes

All four issues addressed and implemented:

### 1. ✅ Score Normalization (Player-Count Independent)
**Problem:** Score scales varied wildly by game size
- 2 players: max ~200
- 4 players: max ~50
- 12 players: max ~16

**Solution:** Normalize to 0-200 scale
```javascript
normalizedScore = (wealthScore + civicScore) × (playerCount / 2)
```

**Result:**
- All game sizes now use 0-200 scale
- 0-50: Below average
- 50-100: Average player
- 100-150: Strong player
- 150-200: Winning position

### 2. ✅ New Early Victory Condition
**Old:** Score ≥ 50.0 AND population ≥ 100 (broken, didn't scale)

**New:** Score ≥ (average + 75) after day 30
- Scales automatically with player count
- Requires dominant lead to win early
- Prevents grinding/stalling strategies

**Examples:**
- 2-player game: Need ~175 score (vs. avg ~100)
- 4-player game: Need ~125 score (vs. avg ~50)
- 12-player game: Need ~91 score (vs. avg ~16)

### 3. ✅ Fixed Sept 1 Victory Trigger
**Problem:** Victory screen not showing on Sept 1

**Solution:**
- Victory check now properly triggers at gameTime ≥ 365
- Broadcasts GAME_VICTORY (not GAME_OVER) for client compatibility
- Includes full scoreboard and winner info

**Changes:**
- [server-room-manager.js:384-390](server-room-manager.js#L384-390) - Sept 1 check
- [server-room-manager.js:442-473](server-room-manager.js#L442-473) - Victory broadcast with scores

### 4. ✅ Aug 1 Warning Modal
**New Feature:** On day 335 (Aug 1), show warning modal

**Content:**
- "⏰ ONE MONTH REMAINING"
- Current leaderboard standings
- Strategy tips for final sprint
- Auto-closes after 10 seconds

**Implementation:**
- [server-room-manager.js:368-382](server-room-manager.js#L368-382) - Server sends ONE_MONTH_WARNING
- [one-month-warning.js](one-month-warning.js) - Client-side modal handler
- [index.html:3603](index.html#L3603) - Script inclusion

## Normalization Examples

### 2-Player Game
```
Player A: 60 wealth + 40 civic = 100 × 1 = 100
Player B: 40 wealth + 60 civic = 100 × 1 = 100
Average: 100
Early victory needs: 175
```

### 4-Player Game
```
Player A: 30 wealth + 25 civic = 55 × 2 = 110
Player B: 25 wealth + 25 civic = 50 × 2 = 100
Player C: 25 wealth + 25 civic = 50 × 2 = 100
Player D: 20 wealth + 25 civic = 45 × 2 = 90
Average: 100
Early victory needs: 175
```

### 12-Player Game
```
Top player: 12 wealth + 10 civic = 22 × 6 = 132
Average player: 8 wealth + 8 civic = 16 × 6 = 96
Weak player: 5 wealth + 5 civic = 10 × 6 = 60
Average: 96
Early victory needs: 171
```

**Result:** All game sizes have similar score distributions!

## Known Issues / Future Improvements

### Potential Adjustments
1. **Early victory threshold (75)** - May need tuning based on playtesting
2. **Aug 1 warning day (335)** - Could be earlier (day 300 = July 1?)
3. **Auto-close timer (10s)** - May be too short/long

### Future Features
1. **Halfway point warning** - Day 182 (March 1) checkpoint
2. **Quarterly reports** - Every 91 days show standings
3. **Score history graph** - Track score progression over time
4. **Victory prediction** - "At this pace, you'll score X by Sept 1"

1. ✅ Player-count independent scoring (0-200 scale)
2. ✅ New early victory condition (avg + 75)
